    * google-like +/- query syntax
    * login not required, but country/net filters and export won't be available
* filters:
    * country:
    * hostname:
    * net:
    * os:
    * port:
* mostly port 80, but some 21/22/23

    * up to 1000 results per credit
* using shodan for penetration testing
    * ethical issues:
        * is it acceptible under any circumstances to view config of device that requires no authN to view?
        * viewing config using default u/p?
        * unique u/p?
        * changing config?
    * requires basic familiarity w/ http banners & status codes
