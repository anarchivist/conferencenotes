*   Reasons for updating 
    *   Board of Trustees charged
    *   Clarify/expand opportunites for sharing among members and nonmembers
    *   Changing information landscape
    *   Modernize language
    *   so members can receive a “fair return” by record uses by non-OCLC members
    *   Attempts to download worldcat in its entirety
    *   “Commercial entities have been trying to resell”
*   Reactions to revised policy 
    *   Questions and use cases 
        *   Impossible to manage all use cases from within policy text
        *   Became able to anticipate questions that would arise immediately
    *   Are FAQS part of the policy? Yes
*   Similarity between guidelines and revised policy: 
    *   Noncommercial sharing of data among LAMs
    *   Consortial union catalogs/resource sharing
    *   Exposure of data in ILSes/discovery layers
    *   Enduser data sharing from catalogs
    *   Requirements for separate agreements with orgs making commercial use of data
    *   ” ” with orgs using data that doesn’t represent their own collections
*   Key differences 
    *   Revised policy is framed as a legal document
    *   Ensure use of OCLC-member created records benefits cooperative and offers fair return to members from external use
*   “Fair return” 
    *   New/enhanced content (GBS agreement 5/08)
    *   Making lib workflow lest costly (WC Partners - Blackwells)
    *   Traffic driven from “popular web sites” to library collections via worldcat.org
*   Other questions 
    *   “I paid for the records” - in actuality, they belong jointly between members and OCLC 
        *   Misses point - 2% of records in ILS average made/created/contributed by a given organization
    *   “Cataloger records were paid for by taxpayer dollars …” 
        *   Probably not true
        *   OCLC members also share infrastructure and services
        *   Costs of not being a member are greater than members considering infrastructure/services
        *   Comparison to swimming pools: more than water: lifeguards, swim lessons, water slides - cost sharing - admission rates pay for pool and services, and provides terms for non-resident use
*   Data sharing landscape 
    *   Evaluation of polices and licenses related to use and re-use of metadata and content - both commercial and NC data providers
    *   Prevailing opinion in the blogosphere: “data should be free and open”
    *   Reality: nearly every organization has terms and condition
    *   Perspective on open date correlated with economic interest & how financial viability is achieved
    *   OCLC “relies on covering costs of infrastructure and services based on member-contributed metadata” 
        *   “slowly liberalizing data sharing process but process has been and is painful”
    *   “Others people’s data should be free”
    *   “Many of those who speak about data sharing have agendas”
    *   Other people: “Others’ data should be free but mine shouldn’t be”
    *   Fair exchange of value between partners
    *   “some people would have us believe that there are heros and villains in this story”
*   OCLC needs to adopt policies which: 
    *   reduce operational costs for infrastructure/services
    *   Exposure of metadata and collections in as many places as possible
    *   More traffic to libraries from popular web sites
    *   Libraries need partners “on the network”
*   Are shared services and metadata worth having? 
    *   Cost sharing, iterative work of catalogers
    *   “OCLC staff make a massive investment in maintaining WC and making members’ data work harder”
    *   Share a comprehensive international union catalog
    *   Share resources of other libraries and make the collective collections of libraries more visible on web
*   Are OCLC’s public purposes still relevant to libraries? 
    *   Cooperative network to promote evolution of library use, libraries and librarianship
*   Fundamental questions: 
    *   Community norms - best practices for collaboratively sharing/creating data nd for sharing system?
    *   How are norms articulated? Voluntary?

———- OCLC should provide services to build out this functionality in the ways that … Google AppEngine

*   Z39.50? - Yes, there’s authorization
*   Pricing goes down as membership increases - can we have a tangible example? — Yes

———- Libraries seem to react badly to harvesting.

“this isn’t about libraries, about what they do or what they’re expected to do”

———- Harvest set - 3M records - free of charge w/ application 

Deduping algorithms for OCLC no longer worked following Oracle migration

Copyrightable aspect of database has origin in curatorial role of data - deduping algorithms, collocating of headings, fiction finder 

What about subject-based union catalogs for example?
