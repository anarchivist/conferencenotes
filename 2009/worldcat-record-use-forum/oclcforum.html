<li>Reactions to revised policy
<ul>
<li>Questions and use cases
<ul>
<li>Impossible to manage all use cases from within policy text</li>
<li>Became able to anticipate questions that would arise immediately</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Are FAQS part of the policy? Yes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Similarity between guidelines and revised policy:
<ul>
<li>Noncommercial sharing of data among LAMs</li>
<li>Consortial union catalogs/resource sharing</li>
<li>Exposure of data in ILSes/discovery layers</li>
<li>Enduser data sharing from catalogs</li>
<li>Requirements for separate agreements with orgs making commercial use of data</li>
<li>&#8221;                                  &#8221; with orgs using data that doesn&#8217;t represent their own collections</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Key differences
<ul>
<li>Revised policy is framed as a legal document</li>
<li>Ensure use of OCLC-member created records benefits cooperative and offers fair return to members from external use</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&#8220;Fair return&#8221;
<ul>
<li>New/enhanced content (GBS agreement 5/08)</li>
<li>Making lib workflow lest costly (WC Partners - Blackwells)</li>
<li>Traffic driven from &#8220;popular web sites&#8221; to library collections via worldcat.org</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Other questions
<ul>
<li>&#8220;I paid for the records&#8221; - in actuality, they belong jointly between members and OCLC
<ul>
<li>Misses point - 2% of records in ILS average made/created/contributed by a given organization</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&#8220;Cataloger records were paid for by taxpayer dollars &#8230;&#8221;
<ul>
<li>Probably not true</li>
<li>OCLC members also share infrastructure and services</li>
<li>Costs of not being a member are greater than members considering infrastructure/services</li>
<li>Comparison to swimming pools: more than water: lifeguards, swim lessons, water slides  - cost sharing - admission rates pay for pool and services, and provides terms for non-resident use</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Data sharing landscape
<ul>
<li>Evaluation of polices and licenses related to use and re-use of metadata and content - both commercial and NC data providers</li>
<li>Prevailing opinion in the blogosphere: &#8220;data should be free and open&#8221;</li>
<li>Reality: nearly every organization has terms and condition</li>
<li>Perspective on open date correlated with economic interest &amp; how financial viability is achieved</li>
<li>OCLC &#8220;relies on covering costs of infrastructure and services based on member-contributed metadata&#8221;
<ul>
<li>&#8220;slowly liberalizing data sharing process but process has been and is painful&#8221;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&#8220;Others people&#8217;s data should be free&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Many of those who speak about data sharing have agendas&#8221;</li>
<li>Other people: &#8220;Others&#8217; data should be free but mine shouldn&#8217;t be&#8221;</li>
<li>Fair exchange of value between partners</li>
<li>&#8220;some people would have us believe that there are heros and villains in this story&#8221;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>OCLC needs to adopt policies which:
<ul>
<li>reduce operational costs for infrastructure/services</li>
<li>Exposure of metadata and collections in as many places as possible</li>
<li>More traffic to libraries from popular web sites</li>
<li>Libraries need partners &#8220;on the network&#8221;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Are shared services and metadata worth having?
<ul>
<li>Cost sharing, iterative work of catalogers</li>
<li>&#8220;OCLC staff make a massive investment in maintaining WC and making members&#8217; data work harder&#8221;</li>
<li>Share a comprehensive international union catalog</li>
<li>Share resources of other libraries and make the collective collections of libraries more visible on web</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Are OCLC&#8217;s public purposes still relevant to libraries?
<ul>
<li>Cooperative network to promote evolution of library use, libraries and librarianship</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fundamental questions:
<ul>
<li>Community norms - best practices for collaboratively sharing/creating data nd for sharing system?</li>
<li>How are norms articulated? Voluntary?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;- OCLC should provide services to build out this functionality in the ways that &#8230; Google AppEngine</p>

<ul>
<li>Z39.50? - Yes, there&#8217;s authorization</li>
<li>Pricing goes down as membership increases - can we have a tangible example? &#8212; Yes</li>
</ul>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;- Libraries seem to react badly to harvesting.</p>

<p>&#8220;this isn&#8217;t about libraries, about what they do or what they&#8217;re expected to do&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;- Harvest set - 3M records - free of charge w/ application </p>

<p>Deduping algorithms for OCLC no longer worked following Oracle migration</p>

<p>Copyrightable aspect of database has origin in curatorial role of data - deduping algorithms, collocating of headings, fiction finder </p>

<p>What about subject-based union catalogs for example?  </p>
